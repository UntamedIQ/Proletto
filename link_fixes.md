# Proletto Link Structure and Fixes

## Overview

This document outlines the link structure of the Proletto platform and the fixes implemented to ensure consistent navigation throughout the application.

## Primary Link Structure

### Main Site Navigation
- `/` - Homepage
- `/opportunities` - Opportunity listing page
- `/portfolio` - User portfolio management
- `/auth/login` - Login page
- `/auth/register` - Registration page
- `/auth/logout` - Logout action
- `/membership.html` - Pricing/membership page
- `/how-it-works.html` - Feature explanation page
- `/dashboard` - User dashboard (logged in users)

### Secondary Links
- `/start-trial` - Redirects to registration with supporter plan
- `/get-started` - Redirects to registration
- `/sign-up` - Redirects to registration
- `/sign-in` - Redirects to login
- `/upgrade` - Redirects to membership page

## Legacy URL Redirects

For backwards compatibility and to avoid broken links, redirects have been implemented for the following:

- `/login.html` → `/auth/login`
- `/signup.html` → `/auth/register`
- `/google/google_login` → `/auth/google/login`

## Redirect Strategy

The redirect strategy uses Flask's `redirect` and `url_for` to ensure:

1. All primary navigation links point directly to the current canonical URL patterns.
2. Legacy URLs and alternative patterns are redirected to maintain compatibility.
3. Semantic URLs (like `/start-trial`) provide intuitive entry points to the application.

## Implemented Fixes

1. Updated all HTML templates to use consistent URL patterns for navigation links
2. Added redirects for deprecated URL patterns to maintain backward compatibility
3. Fixed direct template rendering for core sections (/opportunities and /portfolio)
4. Added support for standard marketing URL patterns through redirects
5. Created a link_checker.py tool to verify the status of all routes

## Verification

All links have been verified using the `link_checker.py` tool, which confirms that:
- All primary routes return 200 OK status
- All alternative routes redirect appropriately with 302 status
- No 404 Not Found or 500 Server Error responses for any official link patterns

## Future Considerations

1. Standardize all template URLs through a centralized URL management module
2. Consider moving all marketing pages to a consistent URL pattern
3. Consider implementing API versioning in URL structure for forward compatibility
