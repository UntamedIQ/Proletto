**Art Self‑Learning Bot Architecture & Implementation Plan**

*Overview*: Build a recommendation bot that continuously learns from scraped opportunity data and user feedback—providing personalized art opportunities, detecting scraping anomalies, and optimizing platform workflows.

---

## 1. Data Pipeline

1. **Scraped Data Ingestion**

   * All scrapers write normalized records (title, url, deadline, tags, source) into **`Opportunities`** table.
2. **Feedback Collection**

   * `Feedback` table already capturing user `opp_id` + `rating`.
3. **Feature Engineering**

   * Compute features per opportunity: keyword TF-IDF, source reliability score, historical engagement metrics.
   * Store in a **Feature Store** (e.g. Redis or Postgres view).

## 2. Model Training

1. **Training Job** (daily at 3 AM via APScheduler)

   ```python
   def retrain_recommender():
       # Fetch features & feedback
       X, y = load_features_and_labels()
       model = train_model(X, y)  # e.g. LightGBMClassifier
       save_model(model, path="models/recommender.pkl")
   ```
2. **Cross‑Validation & Drift Detection**

   * Compute AUC/precision metrics and compare vs previous model.
   * If performance drops >5%, send alert to Slack.

## 3. Inference API

1. **Endpoint** `GET /api/recommendations?user_id=<uid>`

   * Loads latest model, user profile, recent opportunities.
   * Returns top-10 ranked opps.
2. **Caching**

   * Cache per-user recommendations for 10 minutes in Redis to reduce load.

## 4. Self‑Healing & Monitoring

1. **Scraper Anomaly Detection**

   * Monitor feature distributions (e.g. average TF-IDF dims). On sudden shifts, trigger a headless‑browser re‑scrape or escalate.
2. **Automated Retuning**

   * If user engagement (click‑through rate) drops below threshold, automatically adjust feature weights or re-trigger full retraining.

## 5. Code Skeleton

**`self_learning_bot.py`**

```python
import pickle, redis
from models import Opportunity, Feedback
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from lightgbm import LGBMClassifier

def load_data():
    opps = Opportunity.query.all()
    fb = Feedback.query.all()
    # build X, y
    return X, y

def train_model(X, y):
    model = LGBMClassifier()
    model.fit(X, y)
    return model

def save_model(m, path):
    with open(path, 'wb') as f:
        pickle.dump(m, f)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    X, y = load_data()
    m = train_model(X, y)
    save_model(m, 'models/recommender.pkl')
```

## 6. Integration & Scheduling

* Add APScheduler job:

  ```python
  scheduler.add_job(retrain_recommender, 'cron', hour=3, id='retrain_model')
  ```
* Expose `/api/recommendations` in your Flask app.

*This plan turns your scraped feeds and user signals into a continuously improving recommendation engine—automating model training, inference, and self‑healing.*
