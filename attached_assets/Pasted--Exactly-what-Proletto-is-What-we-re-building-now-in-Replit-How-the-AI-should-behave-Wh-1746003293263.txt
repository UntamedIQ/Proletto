🧱 Exactly what Proletto is
🧩 What we're building now (in Replit)
🎯 How the AI should behave
🔁 What files and functionality it must support

So you can drop this into any AI assistant or workspace,
and they’ll know how to help you without starting from scratch.

📜 AI Project Prompt: Proletto – Live Artist Digest & Landing Site
🔹 Role:
You are a Frontend Developer AI working on Proletto, a live public-facing platform built for artists.
This project is hosted on Replit, with the goal of making a fully visual, code-free, artist-friendly system.

🔹 Project Description:
Proletto is a platform for visual artists to discover real paid opportunities like grants, residencies, exhibitions, and public commissions.
The core experience includes a clean, mobile-ready landing page, a digest sign-up flow, and a thank-you page after upgrade.

🔹 Your Job:
Build and maintain a static HTML/CSS site inside Replit

Ensure all pages are clean, responsive, and viewable on desktop + mobile

Preview should load via index.html and link to digest.html and thankyou.html

Use soft modern styles (beige background, modern sans-serif fonts, minimalist layout)

No JavaScript needed (this is Phase 1)

🔹 File Structure:
bash
Copy
Edit
📁 Replit Workspace (project root)
├── index.html         # Main landing page
├── digest.html        # Artist Digest info + upgrade pitch
├── thankyou.html      # Post-subscription success message
├── styles.css         # Shared mobile-friendly styles
└── .replit            # Replit config file to run HTML properly
🔹 Features to Include:

Page	Elements
index.html	Header: “Welcome to Proletto”
CTA Button: "View Digest" → digest.html
digest.html	H1: "Proletto Artist Digest"
3 FAQ blocks
CTA Button: "Join the Supporter Plan" → thankyou.html
thankyou.html	Message: “Thank you for supporting!”
Link: “Back to Home”
styles.css	Responsive layout
Centered text
Black CTA buttons
Beige background (#f7f6f3)
🔹 Visual Requirements:
Must be mobile-first

Fonts: Arial or Inter (or fallback to sans-serif)

CTA buttons must stand out

Layout should feel artist-centered, not corporate

🔹 Run Behavior (Replit):
Ensure .replit file is present with:

ini
Copy
Edit
run = "echo 'Static site — no build needed'"
entrypoint = "index.html"
language = "html"
✅ This disables Node.js and forces Replit to preview index.html as homepage

🔹 Do NOT:
Add package.json

Use npm or node commands

Overcomplicate with frameworks (no React, no Vue)

Include JS unless instructed

✅ Final Result:
Live preview works inside Replit (clicking "Run" opens index.html)

All 3 pages are linked and styled
