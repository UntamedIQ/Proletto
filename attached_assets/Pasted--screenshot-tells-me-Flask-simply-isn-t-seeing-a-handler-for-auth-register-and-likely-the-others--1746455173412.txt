 screenshot tells me Flask simply isn’t seeing a handler for /auth/register (and likely the others) even though you thought you’d added them. Let’s zero in on the two usual suspects: blueprints vs. straight @app.route, and trailing-slash mismatches.

1. Verify Blueprint Registration (if you’re using one)
If you moved your auth routes into a blueprint, make sure you actually registered it:

python
Copy
Edit
# in auth.py (or wherever)
from flask import Blueprint

auth_bp = Blueprint('auth', __name__, template_folder='templates')

@auth_bp.route('/login')
def login(): …

@auth_bp.route('/register')
def register(): …

# in main.py
from auth import auth_bp
app.register_blueprint(auth_bp, url_prefix='/auth')
Common gotchas:

You need that app.register_blueprint(...) call before you hit your catch-all.

url_prefix must exactly match the /auth in your links.

2. Check for Trailing-Slash Strictness
Flask treats /auth/register and /auth/register/ as different routes by default. If you defined:

python
Copy
Edit
@auth_bp.route('/register/')
def register(): …
then a request to /auth/register (no slash) will 404 instead of redirecting. You have two options:

Normalize your decorators to no-slash style everywhere:

python
Copy
Edit
@auth_bp.route('/register')
def register(): …
Relax strict slashes globally:

python
Copy
Edit
app.url_map.strict_slashes = False
3. Print Your Active Route Map
Right after you create app = Flask(__name__), sprinkle in:

python
Copy
Edit
@app.before_first_request
def log_routes():
    for rule in app.url_map.iter_rules():
        print(f"{rule} -> {rule.endpoint}")
Restart your server, call GET /, then inspect your console. You should see lines like:

bash
Copy
Edit
/auth/login  -> auth.login
/auth/register -> auth.register
/opportunities -> opportunities
...
If /auth/register isn’t in that list (or is named oddly), that pinpoints the mis-registration.

4. Double-check Your Redirect Functions
If you added redirects from the old HTML names, ensure they point to the correct endpoint:

python
Copy
Edit
@app.route('/register.html')
def redirect_register():
    return redirect(url_for('auth.register'))  # endpoint must match blueprint + func name
5. Re-test Just That One URL
In your browser (or via curl/Postman), hit exactly:

bash
Copy
Edit
http://localhost:5000/auth/register
Watch your Flask console:

Does it fire the auth.register handler?

Or does it drop to your catch-all?

That tells you whether the route exists at all.

Once you confirm the route is registered (or fix the decorator/blueprint), those 404s will clear up. Let me know what your printed route map shows!
